discord theme for people who have cleartype disabled and want to keep their eyesight <br>
all this does is swap gg-sans (discord's native font) with some old microsoft fonts circa 1994

if you want an amazing combo use this with DTM-08 by 11pixels thats my daily driver and i think it looks amazing give it a shot
